 async (req, res) =>{

req = request (data coming from frontend)
res = response (data we send back)
async allows us to use await inside this function.



const { name, age, city } = req.body;

We do object destructuring
This line extracts data sent from the frontend.



INSERT INTO viewtable(name, age, city)VALUES (?, ?, ?)
The ? placeholders are replaced with actual values from the array:[name, age, city]
This prevents SQL injection and is the correct method



error: err.message

This is the original MySQL error, coming from:catch(err)
err.message usually contains:The actual SQL error,Exact failure reason,Machine error description
This message is not for users,
it is for developers & debugging.



router.put("/updating/:id", ... )
router.put()
This creates a PUT endpoint.
✔ "/updating/:id"
This means:
The endpoint URL contains a parameter called id
Example request:PUT /crudapi/updating/3
✔ Where does this id go?
It is stored in:req.params.id
Why? Because:
params = URL parameters
body = data you send in JSON



const { name, age, city } = req.body;
This extracts update data sent from frontend.
This line picks values from req.body and assigns them to variables:
name → req.body.name  
age  → req.body.age  
city → req.body.city



The resource you want to update/delete must be identified in the URL, not the body.
Body is for Data, not for Identifying the Record
Changing ID in body is dangerous
Real IT company practice
Every company uses this pattern:
✔ URL → identifies the target
✔ Body → contains new values
✔ Params → never changed
✔ Body → always changeable data
but technically:
✔ Getting ID from body is allowed
✔ Getting ID from params is allowed
✔ Both work
According to REST API rules:
👉 Resource identification should be in the URL
👉 Data to update should be in the body
Resource identifier (ID) should be in the URL, NOT in the body.
This is the official REST API standard.
